    <h3>Today's Work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Learned that ids and classes cannot start with a digit.
        Yet another small step towards a better future.</li>
        <li>Also learned how to link a stylesheet from a different folder.
        Will continue adding to stylesheet like this.</li>
        <li>Moved files to a deeper folder for per-month organization. 
            Was a little cumbersome to manually change all files.
            Would like to figure out an easier way to do that, if possible.    
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Future</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Make a page to specifically learn grid and flexbox.</li>
        <li>Continue refining Linktree website</li>
    </ul>
