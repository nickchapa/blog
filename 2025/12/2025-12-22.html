    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Web dev is so hard. Sometimes I have no idea where to start or what I even want to achieve.
        But just like with art, maybe it's good to copy some simple websites and go from there.
        So I've been trying to make my own Linktree website
        It's very simple, but it works.
        I suppose now it's just a matter of making it look nice.
        Now that I think of it, the HTML side of things is somewhat simple.
        It's the styling and scripting that will be a little more tricky.
        Like everything, it takes practice.
    </p>
    <p>Writing out these thoughts helps me think and kind of comforts me.
        Instead of thinking about the long road ahead, I have to think one step at a time.
        The same goes for life in general.
        So let's keep going. One day at a time. 
    </p>
